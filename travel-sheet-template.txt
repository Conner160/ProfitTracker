 * Travel Sheet Template Placeholder
 * 
 * This file serves as a placeholder for the actual Excel template.
 * To use your own template:
 * 
 * 1. Save your Excel template as "travel-sheet-template.xlsx" 
 * 2. Place it in the root directory of this project (same level as index.html)
 * 3. Ensure your template has the following structure:
 *    - Row 29 onwards should be available for data entry
 *    - Column A: Dates (starting at A29)
 *    - Column B: Primary locations (starting at B29) 
 *    - Column C: Additional locations (starting at C29)
 * 
 * If no template file is found, the system will automatically create
 * a basic structured template with proper formatting.
 * 
 * The system will automatically insert additional rows if you have
 * more than 22 entries in a pay period.
