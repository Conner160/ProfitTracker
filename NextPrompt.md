I'm continuing development on ProfitTracker, an enterprise PWA for Clear Connections Contracting Ltd. 

**Current Status**: Just completed comprehensive security overhaul (v2.5.2) with:
- Firebase authentication with domain restrictions (@clearconnectionsc.ca, @clearconn.ca, @clearconnectionsltd.ca)
- Email alias support + username-only signin
- Service worker security with file access controls
- Online-first architecture with offline backup
- Professional Clear Connections branding
- Complete documentation system with changelog management

**Next Goal**: Implement Microsoft 365 SSO integration to replace email/password authentication with company M365 credentials for seamless employee access.

**Architecture**: 
- Modular manager system in /scripts/ with window.managerName globals
- Firebase Firestore primary, IndexedDB backup
- Service worker v2.5.2-secure with CACHE_NAME versioning
- Environment-aware logging via window.secureLog
- "Lock this shit down!" security-first approach

**Key Files**:
- scripts/authManager.js (authentication logic)
- login.html (current email/password form)
- config/env.js (environment config)
- sw.js (service worker with security controls)

**Implementation Plan**: Ready to execute M365_SSO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with Azure AD app registration, Firebase Microsoft provider setup, and enhanced authentication flow.

**Context**: Clear Connections employees currently use M365 for all company tools (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint) and want seamless ProfitTracker integration with same credentials.

Follow the coding instructions in .github/copilot-instructions.md for Clear Connections standards, comprehensive commenting, modular architecture, and security-first development. Update service worker versions and changelog for all changes.

Ready to proceed with Microsoft SSO implementation - where should we start?
