# Icon Recommendations for iOS PWA

## Current Icons
- ✅ 180x180 icon (apple-touch-icon standard size)
- ✅ 192x192 icon (Android/general PWA)
- ✅ 512x512 icon (high resolution displays)
- ✅ favicon.ico (browser favicon)

## Recommendation
For optimal iOS PWA support, consider creating a custom square 180x180 pixel icon. This is the standard size for iOS home screen icons.

The current placeholder icons use the ProfitTracker theme color (#2b5797) with a simple "P" design. You may want to replace these with:
- A more detailed logo or icon design
- Company branding elements
- Professional app icon design

## Icon Files Location
All icons are located in the `/images/` directory:
- `icon-180x180.png` - iOS standard size
- `icon-192x192.png` - Android/PWA standard
- `icon-512x512.png` - High resolution
- `favicon.ico` - Browser favicon
